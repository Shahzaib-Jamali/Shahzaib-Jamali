# Hi, I'm Shahzaib Jamali 👋

I'm a dedicated University of Chicago MSCAPP student passionate about harnessing data analytics to drive transformative public policy and promote human development economics. With a robust academic foundation and hands-on experience in policy research and quantitative analysis, I strive to convert complex datasets into actionable insights that inform equitable policy decisions. My education at UChicago has equipped me with computational tools and analytical frameworks, enabling me to bridge the gap between rigorous data science and impactful public policy.

## 🔭 Current Work & Projects
At UChicago, I'm deeply involved in projects that merge advanced machine learning, data visualization, and geospatial analysis to tackle pressing societal challenges. I work on developing interactive dashboards, real-time monitoring systems, and predictive models that illuminate the economic and social dimensions of public policy. My projects often focus on the intersection of human development economics and public policy, where I analyze socio-economic data to support initiatives that improve community resilience and sustainable development.
